# Barnacle Geese Results 

We analyzed barnacle geese data near the Barents Sea from the [Movebank database repository](www.movebank.org) across four years. Barnacle geese predominately live in the Arctic area and migrate every year. A previous simulation study has found that increasing temperatures correlate to and can predict increases in the barnacle goose population.[1] Various indicators of climate change, such as mean daily air temperature, wind, low-altitude cloud cover and timing of spring, have also been associated with barnacle geeseâ€™s migration route.[2,3]
