We analyzed Tundra swan migration data from the [Movebank database repository](www.movebank.org) across four years. These swans migrate across the northern United States and Canada every year. They live on the north east and west coasts of the United States. They migrate to the artic coastal areas of Canada and Alaska to breed.
