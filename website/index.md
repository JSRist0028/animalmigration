# Why we use machine learning to investigate animal migration routes?
Environmental conditions have changed significantly in the past few decades. Many species are sensitive to climate change and alter their migration pathways by long distances or change their migration  timing in  response  to changing  temperatures. Investigating animal migration  routes enables us  to  explore changing patterns  and  anticipate  migration  shifts to help  policy  makers reduce  human  influences  on  these  animals.  Geolocators  are  widely  used  now  to  estimate the position of animals and track their moving routes, especially with small-sized animals. However, it  is  particularly  challenging  and  time-consuming  to  manually  analyze  the  geolocator  data. Machine  learning  algorithms are  crucial  to  bridge  this  gap  and create  accurate  and  informative migration models. 

The overarching goal of this project is to create an easy-to-implement toolthat canpredict future migration routes ofany animal with historic tracking data using an automated machine learning process.
